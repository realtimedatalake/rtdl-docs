# rtdl setup for Delta Lake 🤷🏽‍♂️

rtdl can write your data lake in the [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) table format. It works with local storage or on any cloud vendor that rtdl supports.

To have rtdl build your Delta Lake, you need to enable it in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
* Uncomment the `Spark Services` section.
* In the `Processing Services` section:
  * In the `statefun-manager` container, uncomment the volume that begins with `./deltawriter/module.yaml:...`.
  * In the `statefun-worker` container, uncomment the volume that begins with `./deltawriter/module.yaml:...`.

After these changes and restarting rtdl, any streams that rtdl processes will write in Delta Lake format.
