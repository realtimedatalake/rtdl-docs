# Configure rtdl with Snowflake External Tables ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Snowflake External Table support only works with AWS S3 storage for now. It also follows a non-standard congifuration path for now. It requires updates to the `docker-compose.yml` file. This method of configuration is temporary. We will be moving to a more standard method in the future.

To have rtdl catalog your data lake metadata in Snowflake External Table so you can more easily access your data on with Snowflake, you need a Snowflake data warehouse as a prerequisite. In the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the statefun-functions container:
  * Set `SNOWFLAKE_ENABLED` to `true` (or `"true"` on Mac/Linux).
  * Set `SNOWFLAKE_ACCT` to your Snowflake account name up to the part before snowflakecomputing.com (e.g. rtdl42372.us-east-1).
  * Set `SNOWFLAKE_USER` to your Snowflake username.
  * Set` SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` to your Snowflake password.
  * Set `SNOWFLAKE_DB` to your Snowflake data warehouse.
  * The AWS S3 credentials you provide to rtdl will also be used by Snowflake to access your data lake.
