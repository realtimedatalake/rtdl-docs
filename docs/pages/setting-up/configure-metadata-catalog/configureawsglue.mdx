# Configure rtdl with AWS Glue ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

AWS Glue support follows a non-standard congifuration path for now. It requires updates to the `docker-compose.yml` file. This method of configuration is temporary. We will be moving to a more standard method in the future.

To have rtdl catalog your data lake metadata in AWS Glue so you can more easily access your data on with AWS services, you need an AWS Glue instance as a prerequisite. In the `docker-compose.yml` file, under the statefun-functions container:
  * Set `GLUE_ENABLE` to `true` (or `"true"` on Mac/Linux).
  * Set `GLUE_ROLE` to the ARN of the service account (see [AWS documentation for more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/getting-started-access.html)).
  * Set `GLUE_SCHEDULER_CRON` to a valid cron statement. This determines how often the Glue crawler runs. By default - the schedule is set at 12:00 midnight every day.
