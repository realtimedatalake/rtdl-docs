# Initialize and start rtdl ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The following steps initialize your rtdl instance. It creates required users, databases, 
and tables, and seeds master data.
1.  Clone the [rtdl repository](https://github.com/realtimedatalake/rtdl).  
      `git clone https://github.com/realtimedatalake/rtdl.git`
2.  cd into the rtdl directory.  
    `cd rtdl/`
3.  Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml up -d`.
    * **Note:** This configuration should be fault-tolerant, but if any containers or 
      processes fail when running this, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down` 
      and retry.
4.  After the containers `rtdl_rtdl-db-init`, `rtdl_dremio-init`, and `rtdl_redpanda-init` exit and complete 
    with `EXITED (0)`, kill and delete the rtdl container set by running 
    `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down`.
5.  Run `docker compose up -d` every time after.  
    **Note:** Your memory setting in Docker must be at least 8GB. rtdl may become unstable if it is 
    set lower.
    * `docker compose down` to stop.

**Note #1:** To start from scratch, run `rm -rf storage/` from the rtdl root folder.  
**Note #2:** If you experience file write issues preventing Dremio and/or Redpanda services 
from starting, please add `user: root` to the `docker-compose.init.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` 
files in the Dremio and Redpanda service definitions. This issue has been encountered on Linux.
