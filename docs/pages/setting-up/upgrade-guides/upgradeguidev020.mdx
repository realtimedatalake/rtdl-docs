# Upgrade Guide -> v0.2.0

rtdl v0.2.0 switches from using a PostgreSQL database to store stream configuration data to file-based configuration storage. Each stream configuration is stored in an individual file in the `storage/configs/` folder.  
  
If you were running a prior version of rtdl and want to upgrade to v0.2.0, you have to migrate your stream configurations before upgrading rtdl.
1.  Start your pre-v0.2.0 version of rtdl.
2.  In a different directory, clone the [`rtdl-tools`](https://github.com/realtimedatalake/rtdl-tools) repo.
    *   `git clone https://github.com/realtimedatalake/rtdl-tools`
3.  `cd rtdl-tools`
4.  Run the `migrateconfigs` tool.  
    **Note:** Requires [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) be insalled.
    *   `go run migrateconfigs.go <absolute path to directory in rtdl to contain configuration files>`  
    e.g. `go run migrateconfigs.go /home/rtdl/storage/configs`
5.  Stop your pre-v0.2.0 version of rtdl.
6.  Upgrade to rtdl v0.2.0.
