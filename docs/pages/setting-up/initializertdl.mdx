# Initialize rtdl ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The following steps initialize your rtdl instance. It creates required users, databases, 
and tables, and seeds master data.
1.  Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml up -d`.
    * **Note:** This configuration should be fault-tolerant, but if any containers or 
      processes fail when running this, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down` 
      and retry.
2.  After the containers `rtdl_rtdl-db-init` and `rtdl_dremio-init` exit and complete with `EXITED (0)`, kill and 
    delete the rtdl container set by running `docker compose -f docker-compose.init.yml down`.
3.  Run `docker compose up -d` every time after.  
    **Note:** Your memory setting in Docker must be at least 8GB. rtdl may become unstable if it is 
    set lower.
    * `docker compose down` to stop.

**Note #1:** If you experience file write issues preventing Dremio services from starting, 
please add 'user: root" to the `docker-compose.init.yml` and `docker-compose.yml` files 
in the Dremio service definition section. This issue has been encountered on Linus.  
  
**Note #2:** To start from scratch, run `rm -rf storage/` from the rtdl root folder.
