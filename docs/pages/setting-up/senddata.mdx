# Send data to rtdl
All data should be sent to the `ingest` endpoint of the ingest service on port 8080 -- e.g. http://localhost:8080/ingest.
*   You can send ***any*** json with just ```stream_id``` in the payload and rtdl will add it to your lake.
    ```
    {
        "stream_id":"837a8d07-cd06-4e17-bcd8-aef0b5e48d31",
        "name":"user1",
        "array":[1,2,3],
        "properties":{"age":20}
    }
    ```  
	You can optionally add ```message_type``` should you choose to override the ```message_type``` specified while creating the stream.
	rtdl will default to a message type ```rtdl_default``` if message type is absent in both stream definition and actual message.
*   Alternatively, instrument your website with [analytics-next-cc](https://github.com/realtimedatalake/analytics-next-cc) - 
    our fork of [Segment's Analytics.js 2.0](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/) 
    that lets you cc all of the events you send to Segment to rtdl's ingest endpoint. Its 
    snippet is a drop-in replacement of Analytics.js 2.0/Analytics.js. Using this makes it 
    easy to build your data lake with existing Segment instrumentation. Enter your ingest endpoint
    as the `ccUrl` value and rtdl will handle the payload. Make sure you enter your writeKey in the 
    `stream_alt_id` of your `stream` configuration.
