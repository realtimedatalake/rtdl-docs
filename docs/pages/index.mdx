[rtdl](https://rtdl.io) makes it easy to build and maintain a real-time data lake. You configure a data stream 
with a source (from a tool like Segment) and a cloud storage destination, and rtdl builds you 
a real-time data lake in Parquet format that automatically works with [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/) 
to give you access your real-time data in common BI and ML tools – just like a data warehouse.  
  
You provide the streams, rtdl builds your data lake.
