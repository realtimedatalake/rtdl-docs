<img src="/docs/assets/images/rtdl-logo.png" height="250px" width="250px"></img>  
[rtdl](https://rtdl.io) makes it easy to build and maintain a real-time data lake. You 
configure a data stream with a source - often from a tool like Kafka or Segment - and a 
cloud storage destination, and rtdl builds you a real-time data lake in Parquet format that 
automatically works with [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/) to give you access your real-time 
data in common BI and ML tools – just like a data warehouse. Streams can be routed from  to 
rtdl.  
  
You provide the streams, rtdl builds your data lake.
