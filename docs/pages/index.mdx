# rtdl - The Real-Time Data Lake ⚡️
<img src="/docs/assets/images/rtdl-logo.png" height="250px" width="250px"></img>  
[rtdl](https://rtdl.io) makes it easy to build and maintain a real-time data lake. You send rtdl 
a real-time data stream – often from a tool like Kafka or Segment – and it builds you a real-time 
data lake in Parquet format that automatically works with [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/) to 
give you access to your real-time data in popular BI and ML tools – just like a data warehouse. 
rtdl can build your real-time data lake on AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.  
  
You provide the streams, rtdl builds your data lake.
