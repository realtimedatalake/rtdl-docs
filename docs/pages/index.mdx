# rtdl - The Real-Time Data Lake ⚡️
<img src="/docs/assets/images/rtdl-logo.png" height="250px" width="250px"></img>  
[rtdl](https://rtdl.io) is a universal real-time ingestion and pre-processing layer for every 
data lake – regardless of table format, OLAP layer, catalog, or cloud vendor. It is the easiest 
way to build and maintain real-time data lakes. You send rtdl a real-time data stream – often 
from a tool like Segment – and it builds you a real-time data lake on AWS S3, GCP Cloud 
Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.  
  
You provide the data, rtdl builds your lake.  
  
Stay up-to-date on rtdl via our [website](https://rtdl.io/) and [blog](https://rtdl.io/blog/), 
and learn how to use rtdl via our [documentation](https://rtdl.io/docs/).
