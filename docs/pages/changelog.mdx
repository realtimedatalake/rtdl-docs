# Changelog

## V0.0.2 - 20220209

### What works? 🚀
rtdl is not full-featured yet, but it is currently functional. You can use the API on port 80 to 
configure streams that ingest json from an rtdl endpoint on port 8080, process them into Parquet, 
and save the files to a destination configured in your stream. rtdl can write files locally, to 
AWS S3, and to GCP Cloud Storage, and you can query your data with Dremio on port 9047 (login with 
Username: `rtdl` and Password `rtdl1234`).

### What's new? 💥
  * Switched from Apache Hive Metastore + Presto to Dremio. **Dremio works for all storage types.**
  * Added support for using a flattened JSON object as value for `gcp_json_credentials` field in the 
    `createStream` API call. Previously, you had to double-quote everything and flatten.
  * Added CONTRIBUTING.md and decided to use a DCO over a CLA - tl;dr use -s when you commit, like 
    `git commit -s -m "..."`


### What doesn't work/what's next on the roadmap? 🚴🏼
  * Add support for Azure Blob Storage
  * Add support for Segment Webhooks as a source
  * Add support for more compressions - currently default Snappy compression is supported
